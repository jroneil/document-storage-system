# Document Storage System

A scalable, cloud-deployable document storage system using microservices and Docker. This system allows users to upload, store, and manage documents with advanced features like metadata extraction, search functionality, and AI-based content analysis.

---

## Features

- **File Upload**: Upload documents of various types (PDF, Word, Excel, etc.).
- **Metadata Management**: Store and manage metadata in PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
- **File Storage**: Store files in MinIO (an S3-compatible object storage).
- **Search Functionality**: Index and search documents using Elasticsearch.
- **AI Services**: Perform AI-based tasks like content analysis and classification.
- **Notifications**: Send email notifications for important events.
- **API Gateway**: A single entry point for all client requests.

---

## Architecture

The system is built using a **microservices architecture** with the following components:

1. **Ingestion Service**: Handles file uploads and metadata extraction.
2. **Metadata Service**: Manages metadata in PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
3. **Storage Service**: Stores files in MinIO.
4. **Processing Service**: Processes files (e.g., text extraction, thumbnail generation).
5. **Search Service**: Indexes documents and metadata in Elasticsearch.
6. **AI Service**: Performs AI-based tasks.
7. **Notification Service**: Sends email notifications.
8. **API Gateway**: Acts as a single entry point for all client requests.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI), Java (Spring Boot)
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ
- **Object Storage**: MinIO
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose
